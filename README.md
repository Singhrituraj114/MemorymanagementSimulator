MemoryManagementSimulator: Operating System Memory Visualization Tool ðŸ’¾
This document serves as the official README for the MemoryManagementSimulator project.

Overview
MemoryManagementSimulator is an advanced, cross-platform simulation tool developed to provide a clear, interactive demonstration of various operating system memory management techniques. By visualizing memory allocation, deallocation, and fragmentation under different strategies, the simulator serves as an invaluable educational and analytical asset for students, educators, and system performance analysts. It helps in understanding the fundamental impact of management choices on overall system efficiency.

Key Features
The simulator provides comprehensive support for visualizing and analyzing several critical memory management algorithms:

Contiguous Allocation Strategies:

First Fit: Allocates the first free block large enough to satisfy the request.

Best Fit: Allocates the smallest free block large enough to satisfy the request, minimizing internal fragmentation.

Worst Fit: Allocates the largest free block, leaving the largest possible remaining hole for future allocations.

Non-Contiguous Allocation Strategies:

Paging: Simulates virtual memory partitioning into fixed-size blocks (pages and frames).

Segmentation: Simulates the division of memory into logical units (segments).

Visualization: Real-time visual representation of memory usage and block allocation.

Customization: Support for defining custom initial memory block configurations and process load profiles.

Performance Analysis: Metrics and reports on fragmentation, memory utilization, and allocation efficiency for each strategy.

Installation
The simulator is designed for straightforward installation and deployment.

1. Cloning the Repository
Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MemoryManagementSimulator.git
cd MemoryManagementSimulator
2. Dependency Management
If the simulator is built with Python, install the necessary dependencies using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: If the project is implemented in a compiled language like C/C++, this step may be replaced by a compilation process, e.g., make.)

Usage
1. Execution
Run the simulator using the appropriate command:

Python:

Bash

python main.py
Compiled Binary (C/C++):

Bash

./MemoryManagementSimulator
2. Input Format
The simulator accepts a list of process requests, typically provided via a file or standard input. Each request must specify the Process ID and the Memory Size Required (in arbitrary units, e.g., KB or bytes).

CSS

[Process ID] [Memory Size Required]
Example Input:

Process ID	Memory Size Required
P1	100
P2	200
P3	50

Export to Sheets
3. Output & Analysis
Upon completion of the simulation, the program will generate a memory allocation table detailing the final state of memory. This output provides clear insight into which processes were successfully allocated and their starting addresses/locations, along with performance statistics related to the chosen management strategy (e.g., fragmentation report).
